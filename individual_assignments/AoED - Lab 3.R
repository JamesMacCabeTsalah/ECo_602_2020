# You can also use the 'here' package to download and read data files into R from your local drive
# here() works from your working directory, and you need to input subsequent coordinates within that working directory for it to identify it
# Your working directory is by default based off of the folder which holds your R-script file!
# You can also manually set your working directory with setwd() - this is unsafe because your wd can always change
# getwd() - tells you what your current working directory is

# You can use install.packages() - or search them directly within R-Studio to download 'here' or any other package
# Using install.packages() or require() is helpful if you have unique code using unique packages because if someone wants to use your code, it streamlines their ability to use it

# You can then use read.csv to input the here() into your global environment

# Library() and require() allow you to load extra packages that you;ve installed
# Library() will re-load already loaded packages, while require() will check if it's already loaded and will decide whether or not it needs to activate it (does not reactivate)
# Using this at the beginning of your script is helpful!
